PROJECT REPORT : CampusAtlas

Team Members


In this project, we tried to create a database on the universities in Turkey and the departments they have. Since we used real data, we continued with Bandırma University in the tables where more detailed information is given. 
The academics table includes only the academicians who have staff in undergraduate departments.  We pulled all the data with data scraping on ‘YÖK ATLAS’ and we used python while doing all this.
